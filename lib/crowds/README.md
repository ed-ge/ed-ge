This folder contains the dependencies for crowd simulation and the accompanying license.

The crowd simulation library is a modification of the [rvo2-js](https://github.com/palmerabollo/rvo2-js) library. The website about the original rvo2 project can be found [here](http://gamma.cs.unc.edu/RVO2/).
